Here comes your first choice: Your friends decide to go jump off a bridge, will you join them?
You went with your friends and jumped off a bridge into the lake and had a great time! Now they invite you to go get ice cream, do you go with them?
DEADYou went to get ice cream with your friends! Upon walking in the front door though, you slip on an ice cream cone a child dropped a few moments before. You broke your neck and died on the spot.
END
You went back home to tell your mother about your cliff jumping. Your mom gets really angry at your poor decision. She starts yelling at you, calling you names. Do you yell back?
DEADYour mom gets more angry at your disrespectful attitude and hits you in the head with a frying pan.
END
You take the hurtful words from your mother and then go to your bedroom. In your room you are deciding if you want to sleep or play video games. Which activity do you choose?
You sleep peacefully into the night. While sleeping, you hear a loud noise outside of your bedroom door. Do you go inspect where the noise comes from?
You realize the noise is an intruder! Do you stay and fight or run back to your room?
You grabbed the frying pan and beat that intruder back to his momma's house. After the incident, your mother asks you what happened. Do you tell your mother you beat him with one of her frying pans or lie and say he ran off?
Your mother gets upset for using her good frying pan and kicks you out of the house. You are now out on the streets, cold and tired. Do you go to your friends house or try to go back home?
You roll over to your best bud's spot around the corner. Your friends all get together with some mixers so y'all can get litty. Your friend offers you a drink. Do you choose to drink the lemonade or sprite?
Your friends forgot to mention that the lemonade had been spiked with L$D.
You start trippin uncontrolably and hallucinating. You see a human sized spider chilling on the couch. Do you go grab a knife and kill it or ignore it and sit with the spider on the couch?
You grab the knife and stab the spider 17 times until it stops saying "bro wtf. The spider turned out to actually just be your buddy, innocently watching Bandersnatch. You and your other buddies laugh at the fact you thought he was a spider. Do you hide the body or call the police?
You and your friends throw the body in the back of the truck and drive over to the 360 bridge. Getting out of the truck you see a cute puppy. Do you go pet the puppy or leave it alone?
DEADThe cute puppy was actually a wolf. The wolf mauls your whole face off.
END
The puppy wonders off into the trees while you tend to your important business. You throw the dead body over the bidge into the water. Hooray! A few seconds later, you see something emerge from the water. It's your friend coming back... as a zombie!? Do you get back in the truck and run away or post on social that there's a zombie on the loose? 
DEADYou and your remaining friends attempt to run away from the zombie and crash the truck into a tree. There were no survivors.
END
DEADThe authorities see your post and arive on the scene, only to discover the dead body floating in the water and you tripping out on drugs. You were arrested and charged with homicide and drug abuse. You will now be serving a sentence of 25 years to life.
END
DEADThe police arive on scene only to find you holding a knife covered in blood and your friend dead on the couch. The police immediately fire their weapons on you, mistaking your black hoodie for dark skin. You're dead.
END
You take a seat next to the spider. The spider turned out to be a really cool dude. He even made you a blanket from it's web. The blanket is so comfortable it put you to sleep. Though, you wake up 15 minutes later to the spider eating your face off. Do you run to the bathroom to check the mirror or run out of the house?
You check your face in the mirror and it's gone! All gone... nothing left. Do you put yourself out of your missery or allow yourself to live the rest of your life with no face?
DEADYou grab the revolver you know your buddy hides under his bathroom sink, and release yourself from a faceless life. Too bad you failed to realize that your face was just fine, you were only tripping on drugs.
END
DEADYou make the brave decision to live without a face. You walk out of the bathroom and scream "I'm ugly and I'm proud!" Your hideousness spooked one of your friend and he shot you in your nonexistent face.
END
DEADYou frantically run out of the house and into the street where a car mistakes you for a hideous monster and runs you over.
END
DEADThe Sprite tasted a little funny. You come to find out that the Sprite was spiked with Codeine. You were drinking lean. You begin to feel light headed so you go sit down on the couch to watch Netflix. In your daze, you fail to realize that your friend tripping on acid has mistaken you for a very large spider. Your friend begins to stab you with a knife while all you can mutter is "wtf bro. You died on the couch.
END
DEADYou find that your window was left unlocked so you go inside. Your mom thinks that the intruder came back and unintentionally blammies you with a shotgun.
